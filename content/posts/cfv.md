[*tl;dr* our call for volunteers is [open](https://forms.gle/fir7iteLPtCajEUZ9)]

OggCamp is all about community - it is, in the most literal sense, made *by* the community, *for* the community.

Firstly of course: OggCamp is an *unconference*, so the attendees make the content of the event, on the day(s) (apart from [talks on one scheduled track](https://www.oggcamp.org/posts/cfp/)).

The other thing about being made by the community, is that we need volunteers to help us to run the event!

The **OggCamp Crew** is legendary - the lovely humans who help to make sure that everything is where it is needed, and that folks are safe and happy during the event. We want to make sure that there are enough people in the crew, that they also get time to take part in the sessions that are interested in.

What's involved? Well in general, the crew handles tasks such as greeting arrivals at check-in, helping to run the merchandise stand, being "runners" to support speaker requirements, getting rooms set up, etc.

As we mentioned in our previous posts, being run by volunteers, OggCamp doesn't have a budget to pay for travel and accommodation for speakers, attendees, or crew. Crew members do, however, get an exclusive version of the annual event t-shirt, as a thank you for their help (and to make them visible at the event).

If you're willing to help out, we've got [a handy form over here](https://forms.gle/fir7iteLPtCajEUZ9). We're asking for help on Friday evening (24th April) for venue setup, as well as the morning and afternoon on Saturday (25th April) and the same slots on Sunday (26th April). Sign up for as much or as little time as you like, and we'll work out a schedule so folks get time to participate / will not miss things that are important to them.

Oh! And don't forget to **tell your friends about OggCamp**, and make sure they get a [ticket](https://tickets.oggcamp.org) as well! It should be a great weekend for everyone.

Looking forward to seeing you in Manchester 🎉
